This repository collects historical notes, timelines, and references centered on the evolution of games (both analog and digital), the visual technologies that enabled them, and their place in art history. Use this README as an index while the repository grows.

## Game history

### Press Start — Video Games

#### Part 1 | Prehistoric Games

* Chess and Checkers
* NIM
* OXO
* Tennis for Two
* Early technical demos and models

  * Railroad Club / Spacewar! (technical and university demos)

#### Part 2 | Atari — Arcade Era

* Dabney \& Bushnell: arcade engineering and commercial arcade machines

  * Computer Space — one of the first commercially sold video games

* Test → PONG — breakout arcade success
* The era of knock-offs, clones, and rapid hardware iteration

#### Part 3 | Home Consoles

* Ralph Baer : Created a prototype with two light guns using photo sensors for on-screen targets
* The Brown Box : various games on 1 console with 2 controllers
* Magnavox Odyssey: Commercial version of the Brown Box, launched 22 May 1972 with TV overlays and extra accessories.
  * **Problems:** Expensive, silent, sold with separate accessories, and misleadingly marketed as TV-exclusive.
* Home Gaming
  * **Magnavox Odyssey:** First home console; promoted at trade shows and inspired Nolan Bushnell to create broader market games.

#### Part 4 | Atari - Console Era

* Atari Pong: Bushnell faced many arcade copycats, focused on original ideas, and released a simple 1974 home Pong console that popularized home gaming.
* Next step : success led to many imitators. Atari shifted focus to microprocessors, enabling game cartridges
* Fairchild VES (1974): Cartridge console with pause button; weak games but inspired Atari.
* Atari VCS (1977): Released to compete with the VES; came with multiple controllers and a Combat cartridge; quickly outsold Fairchild and dominated the market.

#### Conclusion
**Atari Dominance:** Led the early 1980s market, but poor management and talent loss threatened quality.

### Console Wars

#### Part 1 | First Video Game Crash

* Too many (bad) games
* Games were easy to duplicate → less expensive
* Atari : licensed **Pac-Man** for the **VCS**
  * ET - Worst game ever
* Consoles relied on arcade conversions
* Reasons:
  * Oversaturated market with poor-quality
  * outdated games.
  * Unsold stock hurt retailers and bankrupt developers.
  * Surviving developers made cheap $5 games.

#### Part 2 | Nintendo

* Started as a playing card company
* License Magnavox odyssey for Japanese market
* producing arcade games
* Game and Watch - Potential of the business
  * took inspiration from fiddling with a calculator
  * D-pad : four buttons at the extremity of each direction

  * assigned Shigeru Miyamoto
* Miyamoto
  * Genius at video game design

  * used different non-licensed characters and changed the name to **Jumpman**
* Donkey Kong
  * Nintendo's first videogame mega-smash
  * Renamed "Jumpman" to **Mario**
* Famicom
  * Cartridge-based console
  * Designed exclusively for playing games
  * Circuitry problems → Recall all Famicoms
* Nintendo Seal of Quality
  * NA-game market was sick of playing bad games
  * Era of Japanese dominance began
* Super Mario Bros.
  * Technical innovation : side-scrolling
  * 

Showed consumers were becoming more discerning, not uninterested.
### Rise of Sony | Playstation
#### Part 1 | Sony - Rise of Playstation
* Nintendo-Sony deal fallout (1990–1991): Nintendo switches to Philips; Sony humiliated but gains impetus to enter console market.
* Ken Kutaragi develops PlayStation: 3D-focused, developer-friendly architecture.
* 1993: PlayStation (PSX) announced; strong third-party support and studios like Psygnosis acquired.
* Early titles and strategy: Ridge Racer, Tekken, Resident Evil, Final Fantasy VII.
* Focus on global developer relations and a software library to ease development.

#### Part 2 | Console wars - Part 2
* Sega Saturn: rushed, complex, expensive; 2D-focused design initially, last-minute 3D redesign.
* 1995: PlayStation launches $299 → Sega Saturn’s poor launch and marketing blunders.
* Tomb Raider demonstrates PS mainstream appeal; Sonic X-Treme cancelled, weakening Saturn.
* PlayStation library broader than Saturn or N64; Nintendo’s N64 innovative but cartridge-limited.
* Sega Dreamcast: online-capable, GD-ROM, strong launch titles (*Sonic Adventure*, *Soul Calibur*, *Jet Set Radio*).
  * Early success, but lost momentum due to PS2 announcement; production ends 2001.

#### Part 3 | End of Sega
* Launched March 2000; backward-compatible with PS1 games.
* DVD playback included → added consumer value.
* USB peripheral support enabled diverse nontraditional games (Singstar, Buzz!).
* Strong early sales, ahead of Xbox and GameCube launches.
* Became best-selling console ever; iconic titles spanned years and defined the era.
